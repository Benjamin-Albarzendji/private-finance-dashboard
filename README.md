### Description
#### This is a project I did to gain a deeper profiency in pandas, streamlit dashboard, and plotly graph visualization. The private finance dataset was found on kaggle.com. This project is mainly for showing prospective employers that I posses the skills to comfortably use Python and its libraries and it should not under any case be considered a analytical project. There was nothing of signifcane to analyse in the dataset.
